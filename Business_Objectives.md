# Business Objectives

## Objective Definition
- **Primary Objective**: Reduce road accidents using AI-powered alerts.
- **Secondary Objectives**:
  1. Increase road safety awareness.
  2. Provide actionable insights to government and private sectors.
  3. Ensure seamless adoption with common GPS systems.

## Success Criteria
- Achieve a 10% reduction in accidents within the first year.
- Drive adoption among at least 30% of drivers.
- Maintain 85% accuracy in predicting high-risk zones.
- Send real-time alerts with minimal delay (under 5 seconds).

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Incorrect or Outdated Data**: Regular updates from trusted sources and user feedback mechanisms.
- **Lack of Real-Time Updates**: Use real-time traffic and weather APIs.
- **System Scalability**: Use cloud-based infrastructure for scaling.
- **Driver Distraction**: Implement clear, concise notifications to minimize distractions.

## Requirements
